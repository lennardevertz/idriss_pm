# Differences and TODOs

# 1. Functional Differences

1.1 Market Mechanism
  - Onit contracts implement a Dynamic Parimutuel Market (DPM):
    • Cost function C(q)=κ·√Σq² to mint/burn bucketed ERC1155 shares.
    • Continuous outcome domain divided into fixed‐width buckets with bit‐packed storage.
  - Planned system still leverages Onit’s DPM cost‐potential:
    • Users stake ABC as a theoretical “cost” input C(q)=κ·√Σq².
    • Invert cost function to mint ERC1155 shares proportional to stake.
    • Compute confidence band (mean ± σ) on‐chain to classify in‐band vs out‐of‐band submissions.

1.2 Asset & Position Model
  - Onit: Bets in native ETH, positions represented by ERC1155 NFTs, protocol & creator fees in ETH.
  - Planned: Global ERC20 (ABC) staking contract; no per‐market NFTs (remove all ERC1155/NFT logic eventually); stakes earn emissions; slashing & rewards in ABC.
  - Virtual payment model: staking amounts act as theoretical cost inputs—no token transfer on share issuance; actual ABC transfers occur only during reward/slashing settlement.
  - ABC staking contract design can reuse UMA’s staking contract implementation almost verbatim.

1.3 Oracle & Resolution
  - Onit: Resolution via privileged resolver array (OnitMarketResolver), no optimistic oracle.
  - Planned: Source submission & verification via UMA Optimistic Oracle; confidence settlement fully on‐chain.

1.4 Phases & Timing
  - Onit: Single betting window → resolution → dispute window → withdrawal delay.
  - Planned: Phase 0 (source submission) + Phase 1 (confidence submission) run in parallel until topic close; immediate aggregation; no separate dispute window.

1.5 Settlement & Incentives
  - Onit: Winners share pot pro‐rata; losers get nothing; fixed protocol/creator commission.
  - Planned: Out‐of‐band scores slashed at fixed bp; slashed tokens redistributed pro‐rata to in‐band stakers with time‐weighting; no market‐creator fee.

1.6 Governance & Configurability
  - Onit: Factory owner sets resolvers and commission rates.
  - Planned: On‐chain governance for UMA bond/liveness, slashing %, emission rate; topics permissionless with per‐topic overrides.

1.7 Data Structures & Dependencies
  - Onit: Bit‐packed mappings, prb/math, Solady ERC1155 + LibClone, nested storage.
  - Planned: Simple mappings topicId→Submission[], Submission struct {user, stake, score%, timestamp}, IOptimisticOracleV2, IERC20.

# 2. Migration To-Do List

- Adapt and integrate Onit DPM modules:
   • Keep OnitInfiniteOutcomeDPMMechanism & OutcomeDomain for cost math and share tracking.
   • Swap ETH payment flows to ABC.token.transferFrom and use stake as cost input.
   • Remove only unused proxy/factory code if no longer needed.
   • Remove NFT mint/burn hooks, TraderStake struct and ERC1155 dependencies as ABC staking replaces per‐market NFT positions.
- Design & deploy new Topic + Submission structs/mappings; also eliminate all NFT-related state (TraderStake, nftId) and ERC1155 imports.
- Integrate UMA Optimistic Oracle (IOptimisticOracleV2):
   • createTopic(..), submitSource(..) with bond & liveness defaults.
- Build ABC staking contract:
   • stake/unstake with 7-day cooldown, emission accrual, stake accounting.
   • Can mirror UMA’s staking contract codebase and parameters almost exactly.
- Implement submitConfidence(topicId, score, stake):
   • transferFrom ABC, record timestamp.
- FinalizeTopic(topicId):
   • compute weighted mean & σ, define band, apply slashing & reward logic.
- Claim rewards/slashed funds:
   • claimInBandRewards(), claimSlashedRebate(), manage claimed flags.
   • Reward/slashing engine can follow UMA’s dispute/reward mechanics; payout is a custom mix of Onit DPM pro‐rata distribution across all “winning” buckets (mean ± σ).
- Add governance (Ownable/AccessControl) for global & per-topic params.
- Emit events & view functions for phases, timeRemaining, submissions, aggregates.
- Write comprehensive unit tests & perform gas/security audits.
